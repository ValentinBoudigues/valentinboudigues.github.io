### Description :

For this project, we had to design and create from scratch, a robot that can solve a maze.

We designed the robot on OnShape and we used an laser cutter to cut the pieces of the robot.

We had to use a Raspberry Pi to control the robot, and we had to use a LiDAR to detect the walls of the maze.

The robot had to be able to exit the maze in the shortest time possible.
