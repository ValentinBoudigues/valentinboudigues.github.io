### Description :

For this project, we had to create a Python program that can generate RSA keys and sign and verify messages using the RSA algorithm.

The program had to be able to generate keys of a reasonable size and to sign and verify messages of any size.

We didn't use any external library for generating the RSA keys for this project.
