### Used Skills :

-   [x] Arduino
-   [x] Sensors
-   [x] Mechanical Design

### Description :

For this project, we had to create a program that would allow us to move a mechanical hand with servo-motors and to control it with our hand. 

To control the hand, we used a sensor on our forearm that would detect the movement of our muscles.
