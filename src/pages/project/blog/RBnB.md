### Description :

For this project, I had to create a program that simulates a sort of AirBnB/auction platform.

The program had to be able to create a user buyer or seller, create a property, create a bid, create a transaction and display the transactions.

The project also needed to run the auction during a certain amount of time, and a wallet system for each user.

When the auction is over, the program had to automatically create a transaction between the buyer and the seller.
