### Description :

For this project, we had to create a web application in Python, using the Dash framework, to manage environmental data for a coffee shop.

We had to create a database, and needed to be able to stock various data like the temperature of a region, the rise of water level at a given point. 

We also had to be able to create a graph to display the data from the chosen country, and a map to display the location of the data.
