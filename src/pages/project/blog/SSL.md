### Description :

In this team project, we had to create a sort of AI for soccer robots for a new RoboCup league.

The robots had to be able to move, shoot, and defend their goal.

The goal was to create a program that would permit us to present the League at the 2022 RoboCup at Guimar√£es, Portugal.
